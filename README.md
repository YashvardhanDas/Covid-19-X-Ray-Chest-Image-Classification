# Covid-19-X-Ray-Chest-Image-Classification

This work is the involves binomial and multinomial classification of X-ray chest images of patients on the categorical basis of Covid-19, Pneumonia(Bacterial), Pneumonia(Viral) and Non-infected cases. The data we will use has been collected by Adrian Xu, combining the Kaggle Chest X-ray dataset with the COVID-19 Chest X-ray dataset collected by Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen of the University of Montreal.

Multiple neural networks have been programmed and tuned to improvise upon the overall accuracy and recall score. These include but are not limited to - VGG16, Inception Resnet V2, VGG19, etc. 

All the respective datasets and ipynb notebooks are included in this repository. For executing the code, please alter the file path mentioned in the corresponding codes accordingly. It is highly recommended to utilize GPUs for executing the neural networks.
